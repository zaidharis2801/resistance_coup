## About The Project

</p>


This is a terminal text-based version of [The Resistance: Coup](https://www.ultraboardgames.com/coup/game-rules.php#google_vignette). I suggest you make yourself familiar with the rules before playing!

In a nutshell:

* You have some character cards representing government officials you have influence over.
* You can perform actions to sabotage other players and reduce their influence (i.e. remove their cards)
* The last person with any cards left is the winner!

The main package to mention here is [Rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich). It was instrumental in making it as pretty as possible on the terminal!

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* This project is built on Python 3.11.
* The packages are maintained with [poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry).

### Steps to get playing

1. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dirkbrnd/resistance_coup.git
```

2. Install the game

```sh
poetry install
```

3. Launch!

```sh
python coup.py
```

## Usage

![Screen Shot](assets/game_state.png)

* When the game starts it will ask your name.
* You will play against 4 other AI players.
* The game will continue until there is a winner (or if you lose you can force a restart...)
* You can play again after winning/losing.
